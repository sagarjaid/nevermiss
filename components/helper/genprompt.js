Interview Questions Structure:

You are allowed to ask a minimum of 1 and max 9 questions in total, balancing across the categories to examine the student based on the "Visa Officer's Evaluation Criteria". Use the provided "interviewQuestions" object as a reference point to out the JSON with appropriate and balanced questions.

For work-related questions, first confirm if the student has work experience. If they do, combine that with an additional relevant question, forming a compound question (two questions in one).

questionCategory enums : [  " universityAndStudyPlans",  "academicsHistory", "studentFinances", "workExperience",  "postGraduationPlans", "otherQuestions" ]

Output the result in the following JSON format, ensuring each object inside balancedInterviewQuestionsArr has all keys - questionNumber should be in sequence, question, and questionCategory with appropriate questionCategory enums.
